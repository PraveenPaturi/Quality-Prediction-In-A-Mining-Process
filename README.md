# Quality-Prediction-In-A-Mining-Process
 The traditional lab-based measurement of silica content in ore concentrates takes approximately one hour, causing delays in the mining process and impacting operational efficiency. Frequent testing contributes to environmental pollution and inefficiencies by reducing the amount of ore processed and increasing tailings. This project aims to predict silica impurity in real-time, using machine learning algorithms such as Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Trees, as well as Deep Learning techniques like LSTM. By forecasting silica content without the need for time-consuming lab tests, the project seeks to enhance mining efficiency and environmental sustainability. Additionally, a web application developed using the Flask framework integrates the trained machine learning model, providing engineers with timely predictions and enabling them to take proactive measures to minimize impurities and improve overall environmental impact.
